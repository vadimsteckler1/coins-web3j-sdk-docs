Overview
=======================================

Coins GO23 Wallet SDK is a lightweight yet powerful open-source SDK that seamlessly integrates Coins Wallet Web 3.0 features into hundreds of dApps.

It allows your users to store Ether and other ERC-20 tokens. Users can then spend these tokens on games, stake them on DeFi apps, and trade them on exchanges. MetaMask does not store only ERC-20 tokens but can also store ERC-721 tokens.

Features
=======================================
Easy: Simplified and improved wallet integration for native mobile applications via deep-linking, without requiring a web application.
Decentralized and reliable: Doesn't depend on external services and relay servers for delivering messages and app-to-wallet communication.
Secure: Utilizes end-to-end encryption with secure key exchange and decentralized identity verification using the well-known URI standard for universal links.
Efficient: Reduces the number of hops between client applications and wallet via support for batch requests.
Open-source: All of the code for Coinbase Wallet Mobile SDK is open source and available on GitHub.
